                    The <strong>Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Research</strong> journal (pISSN 2092-7355, eISSN 2092-7363) is an official publication of the Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology and the Korean Academy of Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Disease and found in 2009. <br><br>

                    Published bimonthly (January, March, May, July, September, and November), the journal features cutting-edge original research, brief communications, and state-of-the-art reviews in the specialties of allergy, asthma, and immunology, including clinical and experimental studies and instructive case reports. <br><br>

                    Contemporary reviews summarize information on topics for researchers and physicians in the fields of allergy and immunology. As of January 2017, AAIR do not accept case reports. However, if it is a clinically important case, authors can submit it in the form of letter to the Editor. Editorials and letters to the Editor explore controversial issues and encourage further discussion among physicians dealing with allergy, immunology, pediatric respirology, and related medical fields. <br><br>

                    AAIR also features topics in practice and management and recent advances in equipment and techniques for clinicians concerned with clinical manifestations of allergies and pediatric respiratory diseases.
