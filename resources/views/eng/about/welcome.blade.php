                    <p class="title">Dear friends and colleagues from around the world,</p>
                    <p>
                        Since its founding in 1972, our Academy has dedicated itself to the care and research of patients with asthma, allergic diseases, and clinical immunologic disorders. Through these sustained efforts, KAAACI has grown into a proud academic society representing South Korea and Asia, standing shoulder to shoulder with leading international organizations. This remarkable achievement has been made possible by the unwavering passion, unity, and dedication of our predecessors, as well as by the steadfast commitment of all our members in their clinics and laboratories.
                        <br><br>
						KAAACI continues to advance its mission through a broad range of academic and public initiatives:
                        <br><br>
						1. International Congresses:<br>
						We host the KAAACI International Congress annually, providing a platform to enhance clinical expertise, advance research outcomes, and promote the exchange of knowledge with distinguished teams around the world. Through these interactions, we also share our insights and experiences with our colleagues across Asia.
						<br><br>
						2. Academic Journals:<br>
						In collaboration with the Korean Academy of Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Disease, we publish two official journals — Allergy, Asthma & Respiratory Disease (pISSN 2288-0402, eISSN 2288-0410) and Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Research (pISSN 2092-7355, eISSN 2092-7363). These journals have evolved to become leading academic platforms representing Korea in the field of allergy, asthma, and clinical immunology.
						<br><br>
						3. Clinical Practice Guidelines:<br>
						Our Academy develops and disseminates clinical practice guidelines aligned with those of the Korean Academy of Medical Sciences. These guidelines play a vital role in enhancing care quality, standardizing treatment, and improving the efficiency of the national healthcare system.
						<br><br>
						4. Research Working Groups:<br>
						Eight specialized research groups — including those on &lt;severe asthma&gt;, &lt;urticaria/angioedema/anaphylaxis&gt;, &lt;allergic rhinitis&gt;, &lt;refractory atopic dermatitis&gt;, &lt;drug allergy&gt;, &lt;immunotherapy/allergens&gt;, &lt;chronic cough&gt;, and &lt;eosinophilic and immune diseases&gt;  — are actively conducting research and successfully leading numerous government-funded projects.
						<br><br>
						5. Public Education and Outreach:<br>
						In partnership with the Korea Asthma Allergy Foundation, KAAACI leads nationwide initiatives to promote education and awareness for the prevention of asthma and allergic diseases, contributing to improved public health and quality of life.
						<br><br>
						To sustain and further develop these important initiatives, I am committed to fostering close communication with our members, collaborating with academic and professional societies at home and abroad, supporting the next generation of scholars, and strengthening the bonds of friendship and unity within our community.
						<br><br>
						I sincerely ask for your active participation and support.<br>
						May health, peace, and hope fill your clinics, laboratories, and homes.
						<br><br>
						Thank you.
