                <div class="sub-tab-con js-tab-con" style="display: block;">
                    Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common skin diseases, with prevalence of up to 20% in children and 1~3% in adults. Clinical aspect and severity 
                    varies according to each patient. When chronic, the disease can be devastatingly relapsing with multiple deterioration and recovery cycles over time. The 
                    diverse factors implicated in AD interact with those of other allergies, such as asthma and allergic rhinitis.
                    <br><br>
                    Especially, the management of Severe Recalcitrant Atopic Dermatitis (SRAD) can be highly challenging for both patients and clinicians. Therefore, the 
                    development of a therapeutic consensus in SRAD is paramount in achieving maximum therapeutic effect and ensuring the quality of lives of patients and their 
                    families.
                    <br><br>
                    As a work group of the Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy, and Clinical Immunology (KAACI), our team published the consensus report on the SRAD treatment in 
                    2010. We suggested therapeutic approaches aimed at personalized medicine, combined therapy, proactive management, and multi-disciplinary team approach against 
                    SRAD to achieve best outcomes. Furthermore, we have been investigating and endeavoring to improve the current management of SRAD to implement best-evidence 
                    clinical practice and validate novel therapeutics.

                    Drug allergy is a relatively recent entry in the list of allergic diseases that has emerged with the advancement of medicine. Its prevalence is expected to 
                    rise with the continuing development of novel drugs, posing significant challenges to health professionals. Drug allergies mostly occur during the treatment 
                    process, which can be detrimental to doctor-patient relationships. Moreover, information on the diagnosis and management of drug allergy is limited, making 
                    real-world clinical practice difficult.
                    <br><br>
                    In this context, the Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology has organized the "Group for the Study of Drug Allergy" with a goal to 
                    facilitate progress in the field of drug allergy, bringing together allergy professionals with various clinical experience who are interested this specific 
                    field. Previous works published by the Group include “Questionnaire Survey on Drug Allergy Testing in Korea” and “Updates on desensitization for 
                    hypersensitivity reactions related to chemotherapy”. The Group will continue to provide opportunities for members to exchange clinical experience and 
                    knowledge and lay out the path for further research in the field of drug allergy.

                    Allergen immunotherapy is a well-established treatment aiming at patients suffering from allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, some atopic dermatitis, and 
                    hymenoptera venom allergy. Allergen immunotherapy is the only treatment modality known to tackle not only the symptoms but also the causes of respiratory 
                    allergies with the administration of gradually increasing doses of allergen extracts over a period of years. Subcutaneous immunotherapy as well as sublingual 
                    immunotherapy were performed at internal medicine, pediatrics, otolaryngology, and dermatology department in Korea.

                    Under the Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology (KAAACI), the Immunotherapy/Allergen work group was established in 2009 for the research 
                    of allergen immunotherapy and allergens. As an immunotherapy related activity, our work group investigated the status of immunotherapy in 2009. The survey 
                    asked about the necessary conditions for invigorating allergy immunotherapy, and presented the opinion that the training program on the principles and methods 
                    are essential.
                    <br><br>
                    Allergen immunotherapy/Allergen work group is ready to organize the challenging issues, and can contribute to the consolidation of allergen immunotherapy 
                    through better understanding of the mechanisms, indications, procedures and clinical benefit of it.

                    While more than 90% of asthmatics are successfully treated with inhaled corticosteroid, severe asthmatics continue to suffer from uncontrolled symptoms and

                    understanding of severe asthma, in terms of definition of patient characteristics and its pathogenesis in order to ultimately develop optimal treatment 
                    strategies are constantly growing and currently many researches are under way worldwide.
