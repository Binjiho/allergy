                        The Allergy Asthma & Respiratory Disease journal (Allergy Asthma Respir Dis, pISSN 2288-0402, eISSN 2288-0410) is an official publication of the Korean
                        Academy of Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Disease (KAPARD) and Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology (KAAACI). Allergy Asthma
                        Respir Dis was found in March 31, 2013, by integrating Pediatr Allergy Respir Dis (the official journal of KAPARD) and Korean J Asthma Allergy Clin
                        Immunol (the official journal of KAAACI). Published quarterly (March, June, September, and December), the journal features cutting-edge original
                        research, state-of-the-art reviews in the specialties of allergy, asthma, clinical immunology and pediatric respiratory disease, including clinical
                        and experimental studies and instructive case reports. Editorials explore controversial issues and encourage discussion among physicians dealing with
                        allergy, asthma, clinical immunology and pediatric respiratory disease and related medical fields. Allergy Asthma Respir Dis also features topics in
                        practice and management and recent advances in equipment and techniques for clinicians concerned with clinical manifestations of allergies and pediatric
                        respiratory diseases.
