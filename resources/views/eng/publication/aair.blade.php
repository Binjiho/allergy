                        The Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Research journal (pISSN 2092-7355, eISSN 2092-7363) is an official publication of the Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy
                        and Clinical Immunology and the Korean Academy of Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Disease and found in 2009. Published bimonthly (January, March, May,
                        July, September, and November), the journal features cutting-edge original research, brief communications, and state-of-the-art reviews in the specialties
                        of allergy, asthma, and immunology, including clinical and experimental studies and instructive case reports. Contemporary reviews summarize information
                        on topics for researchers and physicians in the fields of allergy and immunology. Case reports highlight new aspects of clinical manifestations of allergic,
                        immunologic, or respiratory diseases. Editorials and letters to the Editor explore controversial issues and encourage further discussion among physicians
                        dealing with allergy, immunology, pediatric respirology, and related medical fields. AAIR also features topics in practice and management and recent
                        advances in equipment and techniques for clinicians concerned with clinical manifestations of allergies and pediatric respiratory diseases.
