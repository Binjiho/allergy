                    <p class="title">Dear Members of the KAAACI,</p>
                    <p>
                        For over 50 years since its founding in 1972, the Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology (KAAACI) has been leading in the development 
                        of asthma and allergic diseases in Korea and around the world. Heading to the next 100 years, we expect our seniors and next-generation members to unite 
                        to advance the field of asthma and allergic diseases. Besides, its application to patient care will significantly improve public health and advance 
                        medical innovation.
                        <br><br>
                        Our Society is facing challenges due to rapid changes in the healthcare environment. I am confident, however, that many talented 
                        people will overcome these challenges with intelligence and wisdom and finally achieve change and development of the Society. To do so, all members need 
                        to envision and dream about our Society's future and contribute ideas and actions to move it forward and transform it.
                        <br><br>
                        I look forward to working with all our outstanding members to ensure that our Society continues to advance the science of allergy and clinical immunology, 
                        improve public health, and provide service to society. Moreover, I will seek ways to foster friendship and exchange among members and interact with domestic 
                        and international academic organizations. Above all things, we will strengthen the role and the capabilities of the next-generation members, who will lead 
                        our society so that we can move forward to a better future.
                        <br><br>
                        The KAAACI is a space where all members of our society can communicate and engage in academic activity. We sincerely hope all members will continue to 
                        move forward step by step, holding hands, loving and encouraging one another through active participation and creative efforts.
                        <br><br>
                        Thank you so much.
