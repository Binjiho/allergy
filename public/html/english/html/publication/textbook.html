                    <p>
                        There has been a huge rise of the prevalence and knowledge in the mechanisms and related managements in the area of asthma, allergy and clinical immunology. 
                        It is the valuable time for the physician to treat patients and understand the knowledge in the interested field.<br>
                        Unfortunately, there are few textbook in Korean immediately available in clinical practice and research. The needs to document and summarize the recent 
                        voluminous information drive the new edition of ‘Asthma and Allergic Diseases’ for practicing physicians and young investigators interested in this area.<br>
                        The new edition of our textbook is composed of 57 chapters including chapter 1 ‘Introduction’, chapter 2 ‘Allergen and diagnosis of allergic diseases’, 
                        chapter 3 ‘Common allergic diseases’, chapter 4 ‘Principles in managements of allergic diseases’, and so on.<br>
                        ‘Asthma and Allergic Diseases’ is aimed at updating the patho-physiology, mechanisms, and new treatment approach related to underlying diseases for the 
                        reader who may be a physician, trainee, young investigator, or medical school student.<br>
                        An outstanding group of authors who are medical faculties and are good in their field has been assembled and wrote the contents of each chapter. Senior 
                        professors who are acknowledged leaders in the areas played major roles in editing and organizing this textbook.
